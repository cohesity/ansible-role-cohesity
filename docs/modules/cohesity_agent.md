# Cohesity Agent Management - Linux

## SYNOPSIS
Ansible Module used to deploy or remove the Cohesity Physical Agent from supported Linux Machines.  When executed in a playbook, the Cohesity Agent installation will be validated and the appropriate state action will be applied.  The most recent version of the Cohesity Agent will be automatically downloaded to the host.

### Requirements
* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

### Notes
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
