# Cohesity Agent Management - Windows

## SYNOPSIS
Ansible Module used to deploy or remove the Cohesity Physical Agent from supported Windows Machines.  When executed in a playbook, the Cohesity Agent installation will be validated and the appropriate state action will be applied.  The most recent version of the Cohesity Agent will be automatically downloaded to the host.

### Requirements

* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Powershell >= 4.0

### Notes
