# Cohesity Protection Job

## SYNOPSIS
Ansible Module used to register, remove, start, and stop the Cohesity Protection Job on a Cohesity Cluster.  When executed in a playbook, the Cohesity Protection Job will be validated and the appropriate state action will be applied.

### Requirements

* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

### Notes
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
