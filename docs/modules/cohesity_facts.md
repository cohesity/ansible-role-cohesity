# Cohesity Facts

## SYNOPSIS
Ansible Module used to collect and compile details about a Cohesity Cluster.  The data can be compiled and returned as a variable which can then be used to perform actions based on the collected information.

### Requirements
* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

### Notes
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.

```yaml
- cohesity_facts:
    server: <ip or hostname for cohesity cluster>
    cohesity_admin: <username with cluster level permissions>
    cohesity_password: <password for the selected user>
    validate_certs: <boolean to determine if SSL certificates should be validated>
    state: <level of data collection>
    include_sources: <boolean to determine if specific information should be collected>
    include_jobs: <boolean to determine if specific information should be collected>
    include_runs: <boolean to determine if specific information should be collected>
    active_only: <boolean to determine if only active jobs should be collected>
    include_deleted: <boolean to determine if results should include deleted items>
```

## EXAMPLES

```yaml
# Gather facts about all nodes and supported resources in a cluster
- cohesity_facts:
    cluster: cohesity.lab
    username: admin
    password: password

# Gather facts about all nodes and protection sources in a cluster
- cohesity_facts:
    cluster: cohesity.lab
    username: admin
    password: password
    state: minimal
    include_sources: True

# Gather facts about all nodes and return active job executions in a cluster
- cohesity_facts:
    cluster: cohesity.lab
    username: admin
    password: password
    state: minimal
    include_runs: True
    active_only: True

```


## PARAMETERS

| Required | Parameters | Type | Choices/Defaults | Comments |
