## SYNOPSIS
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-windows)

This task can be used to install and manage the Cohesity Agent on Windows hosts

#### How it works
- The task starts by installing the latest version of the agent will be installed (*state=present*) or removed (*state=absent*) from the `windows` server.
- If *state=present*, then the Windows Firewall rule will be updated to allow the Cohesity Agent to communicate to the Cluster.
- When the *installer_type=volcbt* and *cohesity_agent.reboot=True*, the host will be rebooted to allow the driver to load (*state=present*) or unload (*state=absent*).

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-windows)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Powershell >= 4.0

> **Notes**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
