## SYNOPSIS
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

This task can be used to install the required pre-requisite packages on Ubuntu/Debian and CentOS/RHEL servers and manage the Cohesity Agent

#### How it works
- The task starts by install the required pre-requisite packages on the Ubuntu/Debian or CentOS/RHEL server (if *state=present*).
- Upon completion, the latest version of the agent will be installed (*state=present*) or removed (*state=absent*) from the `linux` server.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

> **Notes**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Prior to using theis task, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see the [official Cohesity Ansible module documentation](/modules/cohesity_agent.md?id=syntax)
```yaml
cohesity_agent:
  state: "present"
  service_user: "cohesityagent"

```
## Customizing your playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

This example show how to include the Cohesity-Ansible role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task as part of the delivery.

### Installation of Cohesity Agent on Linux hosts
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

Here is an example playbook that installs the Cohesity agent on all `linux` hosts. Please change it as per your environment.
> **Note:**
  - Prior to using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

```yaml
---
  - hosts: linux
    # => Please change these variables to connect
    # => to your Cohesity Cluster
    vars:
        var_cohesity_server: cohesity_cluster_vip
        var_cohesity_admin: admin
        var_cohesity_password: admin
        var_validate_certs: False
    become: true
    roles:
        - cohesity.ansible
    tasks:
      - name: Install new Cohesity Agent on each Linux Physical Server
        include_role:
            name: cohesity.ansible
            tasks_from: agent
        vars:
            cohesity_server: "{{ var_cohesity_server }}"
            cohesity_admin: "{{ var_cohesity_admin }}"
            cohesity_password: "{{ var_cohesity_password }}"
            cohesity_validate_certs: "{{ var_validate_certs }}"
            cohesity_agent:
                state: present
        tags: [ 'cohesity', 'agent', 'install', 'physical', 'linux' ]
```

### Installation of Cohesity Agent on Linux hosts installed using Root
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

Here is an example playbook that installs the Cohesity agent on all `linux` hosts using the Root account. Please change it as per your environment.
> **Note:**
  - Prior to using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

```yaml
---
  - hosts: linux
    # => Please change these variables to connect
    # => to your Cohesity Cluster
    vars:
        var_cohesity_server: cohesity_cluster_vip
        var_cohesity_admin: admin
        var_cohesity_password: admin
        var_validate_certs: False
    become: true
    roles:
        - cohesity.ansible
    tasks:
      - name: Install new Cohesity Agent on each Linux Physical Server
        include_role:
            name: cohesity.ansible
            tasks_from: agent
        vars:
            cohesity_server: "{{ var_cohesity_server }}"
            cohesity_admin: "{{ var_cohesity_admin }}"
            cohesity_password: "{{ var_cohesity_password }}"
            cohesity_validate_certs: "{{ var_validate_certs }}"
            cohesity_agent:
                state: present
                service_user: "root"
                service_group: "root"
                create_user: False
        tags: [ 'cohesity', 'agent', 'install', 'physical', 'linux' ]
```


### Installation of Cohesity Agent on Linux hosts using a custom download path
[top](#task-cohesity-agent-management-linux)

Here is an example playbook that installs the Cohesity agent on all `linux` hosts using a custom download location. Please change it as per your environment.
> **Note:**
  - When using the default download location, the Cohesity agent installer will be place in `/tmp/<temp-dir` location.  If your environment prevents the use of `/tmp` with a `noexec` option, then the alternate location must be set.
  - Prior to using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

```yaml
---
  - hosts: linux
    # => Please change these variables to connect
    # => to your Cohesity Cluster
    vars:
        var_cohesity_server: cohesity_cluster_vip
        var_cohesity_admin: admin
        var_cohesity_password: admin
        var_validate_certs: False
    become: true
    roles:
        - cohesity.ansible
    tasks:
      - name: Install new Cohesity Agent on each Linux Physical Server
        include_role:
            name: cohesity.ansible
            tasks_from: agent
        vars:
            cohesity_server: "{{ var_cohesity_server }}"
            cohesity_admin: "{{ var_cohesity_admin }}"
            cohesity_password: "{{ var_cohesity_password }}"
            cohesity_validate_certs: "{{ var_validate_certs }}"
            cohesity_agent:
                state: present
                download_location: "/opt/cohesity/download/"
        tags: [ 'cohesity', 'agent', 'install', 'physical', 'linux' ]
