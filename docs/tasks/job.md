## SYNOPSIS
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This task can be used to add and configure Cohesity Protection Sources

#### How it works
- The task starts by determining if the named endpoint exists in the cluster
- Upon validation, the task will create a new Protection Source (*state=present*) or remove the existing Protection Source (*state=absent*) from the Cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  When *state=absent*, there are no job validations nor state checks to ensure that backups are not running.  If jobs exist for the Source, an error will be raised and the task will fail.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

> **Notes**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Prior to using theis task, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Variables
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

The following is a list of variables and the configuration expected when leveraging this task in your playbook.  For more information on these variables, see the [official Cohesity Ansible module documentation](/modules/cohesity_job.md?id=syntax)
```yaml
cohesity_protection:
  state: present
  job_name: ""
  endpoint: ""
  environment: ""
  storage_domain: DefaultIddStorageDomain
  policy: Bronze

  cancel_active: False
```
## Customizing your playbooks
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

This example show how to include the Cohesity-Ansible role in your custom playbooks and leverage this task as part of the delivery.

### Creation of new Physical Protection Job using the Ansible Inventory
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-job-management)

Here is an example playbook that creates new Protection Job for all Physical hosts based on the registered inventory hostname. Please change it as per your environment.
> **Note:**
  - Prior to using these example playbooks, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.
  - This example requires that the endpoint matches an existing Protection Source.  See [more information on sources here](/tasks/source.md)
