## SYNOPSIS
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

This task can be used to add and configure Cohesity Protection Sources

#### How it works
- The task starts by determining if the named endpoint exists in the cluster
- Upon validation, the task will create a new Protection Source (*state=present*) or remove the existing Protection Source (*state=absent*) from the Cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**!<br>
  When *state=absent*, there are no job validations nor state checks to ensure that backups are not running.  If jobs exist for the Source, an error will be raised and the task will fail.

### Requirements
[top](#task-cohesity-protection-source-management)

* Cohesity Cluster running version 6.0 or higher
* Ansible >= 2.6
  * [Ansible Control Machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) must be a unix system running any of the following operating systems: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS), macOS, any of the BSDs. Windows isnâ€™t supported for the control machine.
* Python >= 2.6

> **Notes**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Prior to using theis task, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.
