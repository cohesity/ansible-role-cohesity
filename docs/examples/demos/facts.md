# Cohesity Facts Collection

## SYNOPSIS
This example play leverages the `cohesity_facts` module to dynamically discover and store all collected information about a Cohesity cluster.
Items collected:
- Cluster Details
- Current Nodes
- All Current Protection Sources
- All Current Protection Jobs
- Protection Policies
- Storage Domains
- Job Execution History for each Current Protection Job

Upon completion of this play, the output is written to a file called `cohesity_facts.json` and stored in the Ansible Inventory Directory.

### Notes
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
