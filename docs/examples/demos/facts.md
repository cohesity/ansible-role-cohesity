## SYNOPSIS
[top](#Cohesity-Facts-Collection)

This example play leverages the `cohesity_facts` module to dynamically discover and store all collected information about a Cohesity Cluster.
Items Collected:
- Cluster Details
- Current Nodes
- All Current Protection Sources
- All Current Protection Jobs
- Protection Policies
- Storage Domains
- Job Execution History for each Current Protection Job

Upon completion of this play, the output is written to a file called `cohesity_facts.json` and stored in the Ansible Inventory Directory.

> **Note:**
  - Currently, the Ansible Module requires Full Cluster Administrator access.
  - Prior to using this playbook, refer to the [Setup](/setup.md) and [How to use](/how-to-use.md) sections of this guide.

## Ansible Inventory Configuration
[top](#cohesity-agent-uninstallation-and-installation-using-ansible-inventory)

To fully leverage this Ansible Play, you must configure your Ansible Inventory file with certain keys and values. This allows for a much easier management of the overall experience.

Here is an example inventory file. Please change it as per your environment.
```ini
[workstation]
control ansible_connection=local ansible_host=10.2.46.94 type=Linux
```
